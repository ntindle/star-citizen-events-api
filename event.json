Celebrants honor the festival with a variety of traditions that differ greatly depending on the system and community who are participating.\n\n\nCommon activities include wearing red items (a color that symbolizes good fortune), honoring friends and relatives who have passed by thinking of them and sharing stories of their influence, and eating foods long in length such as calossk tentacles or noodles dyed red. One of the most popular ways to celebrate is with the exchange of gilded red envelopes. On some worlds the envelopes contain a small token which the receiver is supposed to keep with them for good fortune. Other worlds may include a small amount of credits inside to help those you care about have a strong start in the upcoming cycle.\n\n\nGrowing in popularity is the newer tradition of hiding the envelopes as a way of spreading good fortune and prosperity to those that fate has deemed in need. Banu, in particular, have taken up this last tradition, hiding the Red Festival envelopes in honor of Cassa, their Patron of Luck.",

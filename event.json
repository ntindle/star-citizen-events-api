Throughout the event, you can test-fly military-inspired vehicles, discover new releases, and tour an in-service Javelin destroyer, the UEES War Hammer. And don\u0027t miss the biggest and best UEEN fleet yet as it tours the system throughout the event.",

The event\u0027s origins date back to 2541 and the First Tevarin War, when the UPE would send transport ships to each planet to pick up recruits for basic training. The locals would gather to celebrate those leaving to defend Humanity and marvel at the impressive military ships.\n\nToday, Invictus Launch Week is celebrated in UEE systems with high-flying public demonstrations from the naval fleet. As an added attraction, the galaxy\u0027s top vehicle and defense manufacturers utilize the festivities to showcase the ships and armament they supply to the military.",
